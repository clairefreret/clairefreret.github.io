<BR><h4>Introduction</h4>

<BR>ADDIE is an instructional design model that helps Instructors, Instructional Designers and Training Specialists plan and create instruction. 
<BR>The ADDIE model is used to create all kinds of instruction from showing out to mechanic's students how to repair carburators to training astronauts on launch procedures. 
<BR>In this presentation however we will use simpler examples to illustrate the ADDIE principles. 
<BR>The Addie model includes 5 phases : <BR> 
<BR>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>nalysis</li>
<li><b>D</b>esign</li>
<li><b>D</b>evelopment</li>
<li><b>I</b>mplementation</li>
<li><b>E</b>valuation</li>
</ul>
<BR>Let's take a closer look at the third phase : the Development phase. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
<BR>
<BR>During the design phase, curriculum developers:
<BR>1. Create a Sample
<BR>2. Develop the Course Materials 
<BR>3. Conduct a Run-throuh
<BR>
<BR><h5>1. Create a Sample</h5>
<BR>
<BR>Let's say you have a newspaper route: your boss wants you to teach his kid how to do it while you're away on vacation. 
After going through the analysis and design phases, you'll want to create a <abbr title="échantillon">sample</abbr> of your instructional materials and show them to your boss. 
This may consist of a portion of the map you are going to create and a paragraph or two of the written instructions you are going to write as well as the instructional 
strategy you developed during the design phase. Since he is your client and is going to have final say in the instruction, you're going to want to 
show him your progress and get his ideas and feedback. You don't want to go to the trouble of creating all your <abbr title="ressources pédagogiques">instructional materials</abbr>
 and then <abbr title="découvrir, se rendre compte">find out</abbr> that he didn't like the approach you made or that there was something wrong with them.
<BR>
<BR><h5>2. Develop the Course Materials</h5>
<BR>
<BR>After you and your client are sufficiently satisfied with the sample instruction, it is time to <abbr title="creuser, approfondir, s'y mettre">dig in</abbr> and develop the course materials. 
You should have already decided which instructional activities to include during the design phase when you made your instructional strategy. 
Use that and the sample instruction you made as a starting point and keep the comments and feedback from your client in mind.
 When you are finished developing the course materials, hold a review session with your client and see if he or she has any more comments or suggestions. 
<BR>
<BR><h5>3. Conduct a Run-throuh</h5>
<BR>
<BR>Once you have created your course materials and gone through them with your client, it will be time to conduct our run-through of your instruction. 
This is a real-time <abbr title="répétition">rehearsal</abbr> of the course using all the materials and media you have created.
 In our simple example, this could be showing a friend the instructions and map you created as well as a <abbr title="cheminement">walkthrough</abbr> of your paper route 
if that was part of your instructional strategy. You would treat your friend as if she were the actual student : in this case your boss's kid.
 It's a good idea to prepare a feedback assessment ahead of time as well to find out if there are any areas you can improve on. 
You'll want to time your run-through as well. If your boss was only going to give you an hour to train his kid, you're going to want to make sure you can do it in the allowed time. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>conclusion</h4>
<BR>
<BR>So that's a basic overview of the development phase of the ADDIE model. 
If you've done a thorough analysis and designed the development phase will go a lot smoother though it still takes time to create quality instructional materials. <br>
Next we'll take a closer look at the implementation phase.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            This is the first step of the ADDIE model and relates to the analysis of the learners' needs and the goals to be reached.

          <p>
            This phase is meant to set the learning guidelines: stages, tools, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning and media selection.

        <div class="card-body3">
          <p>
            It is the step when instructional designers and developers create and assemble the content assets that were blueprinted in the design phase.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            During the implementation phase, a procedure for trainers and learners is developed: it includes a review of the course curriculum as well as the teacinh methods.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            This last phase is used to review the training, get feedback, and make adjustments if necessary. The ADDIE Model is a continuous circle with overlapping boundaries.
