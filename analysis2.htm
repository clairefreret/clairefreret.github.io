 <BR><h4>Introduction</h4>

  <BR> ADDIE is an instructional design model that helps instructors, instructional designers, and training specialists plan and create instruction. The ADDIE model is used to create all kinds of instruction, from teaching high school students about calculus to training doctors how to use state-of-the-art medical equipment. In this presentation, however, we will use simpler examples to illustrate the ADDIE principles. 
<BR>The ADDIE model includes 5 phases:<BR> 
<BR>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>nalysis</li>
<li><b>D</b>esign</li>
<li><b>D</b>evelopment</li>
<li><b>I</b>mplementation</li>
<li><b>E</b>valuation</li>
</ul>
<BR>Let's take a closer look at the first phase, the Analysis phase. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
<BR>
<BR>Doing a thorough analysis before developing and implementing training can save a lot of time and resources. 
<BR>
<BR>The Analysis phase generally consists of four sub-phases: 
<BR>
<BR><b>1.</b> The development of instructional goals
<BR><b>2.</b> An instructional analysis
<BR><b>3.</b> A learner analysis
<BR><b>4.</b> The development of learning objectives 
<BR>
<BR>So let's talk for a minute about the first step: developing instructional goals. 
<BR>
<BR><h5> 1. Instructional goals</h5>
<BR>Let's say you have a friend that wants you to teach him how to make pizza. Better yet, his mom wants you to teach him how to make pizza. To do this effectively, you would have to clearly define what the goal of this little training would be. Does she want him to know how to build every type of pizza, from four cheese to alfredo chicken to <abbr title="farci/fourré">stuffed</abbr> crust? Or does she just have a certain type of pizza in mind? Finding out and making a clear instructional goal can save a lot of time and effort. In this case, you would simply have to talk to your friend's mom. She is your client. Once you have clearly defined what your instructional goals are, you will be better equipped to develop the instruction. Let's say your friend's mom wants him to learn how to make a simple pepperoni pizza. That's the instructional goal. Good. Now we can move on to the next part of the Analysis phase.
<BR>
<BR> <h5>2. Instructional Analysis </h5>
<BR>
<BR>During the Instructional Analysis, a curriculum creator defines and writes out all of the steps necessary to carry out the instructional goals. This phase is often not as simple as it seems. In our pizza analogy, it sounds easy enough at first. Just roll out the <abbr title="pâte">dough</abbr>, throw on the sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, and <abbr title="jeter/lancer">toss</abbr> it in the oven right? But it's actually a lot more complicated. Your friend has to know how to make dough, or where to buy it. He needs to know what techniques and tools are required to roll it out. He needs to know the ingredients of the sauce, and how to spread it evenly. There are basic steps, and each step can have its own sub steps. A finished Instructional Analysis is a chart that looks something like this. It is very specific and outlines the goal steps learners need to have to achieve the instructional goal. Many instructional designers are continually adding to and refining their instructional analysis as they go through the other steps of designing training. 
<BR>
<BR><h5>3. Learner Analysis</h5>
<BR>
<BR>The next part of the Analysis phase is the Learner Analysis. This is when you find out what your learners already know about the subject at hand. When you have a specific set of learners, in our example, just one guy, it is easy to do a learner analysis. Just call him and talk to him. If your learning audience is bigger, say 10th grade physics students in the Clark County School District, you may have to do more research, and even conduct interviews and <abbr title="enquêtes">surveys</abbr>. Knowing where your learners stand regarding your subject helps you know how much or how little you teach them. Say you talk to your friend and find out he is a connoisseur of spaghetti sauces and knows how to make a delicious one by heart. Then you know you don't have to go into much detail when teaching him about making pizza sauce. If you hadn't done a learner analysis and found that out, you could have wasted a lot of time and effort teaching him something he already knew about. 
<BR>
<BR><h5>4. Learning Objectives</h5>
<BR>
<BR>Step 4 is creating learning objectives.
<BR>Learning objectives are what students should be able to do when instruction is completed. They are usually in the form of skills, attitude, or knowledge. A good way to write a learning objective is to fill in the following sentence: By the time a student finishes this course, he or she should be able to_________. This is another time when we have to be very specific, and use strong verbs that specifically define student performance. In our example, we know our instructional goal is to teach your friend how to make a pizza. But we need to be more specific with our learning objectives. Based on what we learned in our instructional analysis and learner analysis, we can come up with some good learning objectives. 
<BR>At the end of our course, our student should be able to: 
<BR>1. <u>DESCRIBE</u> how to make pizza dough from scratch. 
<BR>2. <u>DEMONSTRATE</u> how to roll it out evenly. 
<BR>3. <u>SHOW</u> how to add sauce, cheese, and pepperoni correctly. 
<BR>4. <u>EXPLAIN</u> at what temperature the pizza needs to be cooked, and for how long. 
<BR>Knowing what our learning objectives are is going to go a long way in helping us design our course. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>conclusion</h4>
<BR>
<BR>So that's a basic overview of the Analysis phase of the ADDIE model. Can you see how doing this groundwork before creating instructional materials can help you utilize your resources better? Good. Next, we'll talk about the Design phase. Thanks for watching. </p>

            This is the first step of the ADDIE model and relates to the analysis of the learners' needs and the goals to be reached.

            This phase is meant to set the learning guidelines: stages, tools, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning and media selection.

            It is the step when instructional designers and developers create and assemble the content assets that were blueprinted in the design phase.

            During the implementation phase, a procedure for trainers and learners is developed: it includes a review of the course curriculum as well as the teacinh methods.

          <p>
            This last phase is used to review the training, get feedback, and make adjustments if necessary. The ADDIE Model is a continuous circle with overlapping boundaries.
