 <BR><h4>Introduction</h4>

<BR>Addie is an instructional design model that helps instructors, instructional designers and training specialists plan and create instruction. The Addie model is used to create all kinds of instruction, from showing call center employees how to use a new software system to training military personnel to use specific tactical strategies. In this presentation however, we will use simpler examples to illustrate the Addie principles.
<BR>The Addie model includes 5 phases : <BR> 
<BR>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>nalysis</li>
<li><b>D</b>esign</li>
<li><b>D</b>evelopment</li>
<li><b>I</b>mplementation</li>
<li><b>E</b>valuation</li>
</ul>
<BR> Let's take a closer look at the second phase, the design phase. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>DESIGN</h4>
<BR>
<BR>During the design phase, curriculum developers:
<BR>1. Design assessments
<BR>2. Choose a course format 
<BR>3. Create an instructional strategy
<BR>
<BR><h5>1. Design assessments</h5>
<BR>
<BR>It may seem <abbr title="contre-intuitif">counterintuitive</abbr> to design the assessment of a course before you begin creating the content but it is actually very helpful to know how you are going to test your learner's knowledge, attitude and skills about your subject when you are creating your instructional materials. To design effective assessments, you are going to use a lot of what you learned during the previous Addie phase, the analysis phase.
<BR>
<BR>Dick and Carey <abbr title="souligner/indiquer">point out</abbr> that there are 4 areas to consider when designing a good assessment question or task, the instructions:
<BR>- Goals 
<BR>- Learner
<BR>- Context 
<BR>- Assessment
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>goals</li></h6>
<BR>It is very important to consider the goals of your instruction as you design your assessment.
<BR>Let's say you are teaching a group of not-so computer literate folks about how to use email. During the analysis phase, you would have created performance objectives or what the students would do to demonstrate that they learn the content. Now, you can use these performance objectives to help you create effective assessments. If one of your performance objectives was for students to demonstrate how to open up a web browser and sign into a web-based email account, then, you should make sure to test that knowledge at the end of the course.
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>learner</li></h6>
<BR>As you write out this question or task, remember to keep in mind what you learned about your learners during the analysis phase. In our example, your learners aren't very computer literate, so you should avoid using unnecessarily obscure or complicated terms in your assessment. 
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>context</li></h6>
<BR>Whatever possible, you should assess skills like this in a context, as close to the eventual performance setting as possible. Having them answer a multiple-choice question about how to sign into an email account won't be nearly as effective as giving them attach to do so on a physical computer and be sure to be thorough when you research your learner's performance context.
<BR>Let's say you find out that, after your course is over. Your students will be using pcs to write their emails. Then you would do well to <abbr title="évaluer">assess</abbr> them on a PC. It wouldn't be helpful to have them do it on a Mac or on a smartphone. 
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>assessment</li></h6>
<BR>Make sure your assessment questions and tasks are written clearly with correct punctuation and grammar.
<BR>Also avoid the temptation to trick learners by intentionally writing complicated or <abbr title="trompeuses">misleading</abbr> questions. If your instructional goal is to help students learn to use email, then test them on that, not on how good they are at answering <abbr title="questions pièges">trick questions</abbr>.
<BR>
<BR><h5>2. choose a course format</h5>

<BR> Once you know how your learners are going to be tested, then you can go about choosing a course format. The course format, also sometimes called the delivery system, is the medium by which the course content is presented to learners. Courses can be taught in a traditional classroom setting, by correspondence, as a telecourse, through a self-paced workbook, over the internet, or in a blended course <abbr title="un cours d’apprentissage mixte">in a blended course</abbr> that combines different methods. In our example, we know that your students are going to be tested using PC computers. It would be most effective then, to choose a course format that would allow them to use PC computers when you teach them, like a computer lab.
<BR>
<BR><h5>3. instructional strategy</h5>

<BR>Now that you've designed your assessment and picked a course format, you can begin to create your instructional strategy. An instructional strategy is the collection of lectures, readings, discussions, projects, worksheets, assessments and activities to help the students learn the course content. Dick and Carey have outlined 5 major learning components that are part of an overall instructional strategy. They are:
<BR>A. Preinstructional activities
<BR>B. Content presentation
<BR>C. Learner participation
<BR>D. Assessment 
<BR>E. <abbr title="activités de suivi">Follow through activities</abbr>. 
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>a. Preinstructional activities</li></h6>
<BR>When planning your pre instructional activities, first include a way to motivate your learners.
<BR>In our example, you could talk to students about how using email could benefit them, perhaps by helping them pay their <abbr title="factures">bills</abbr> more effectively or keeping in touch with relatives. Motivating your learners will help them see the value of your material and internalize the instruction.
Then plan a way to illustrate the course objectives. This will help them mentally organize the components of the instruction and know how they're going to apply their knowledge. 
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>b. Content presentation</li></h6>
<BR>There are a few things to keep in mind when planning your content presentation. First make sure your content is concise and not filled with unnecessary detail. Just <abbr title="coller">stick</abbr> to the objectives of the class. It may sound fun to relate a history of email and how it got started but it isn't going to help your students reach the objective of the class, and be sure to include examples. This could be as simple as walking students through the process of signing on to an email account on a digital projector.
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>c. Learner participation</li></h6>
<BR>It is very important to plan plenty of learner participation in your instructional strategy. This means allowing your students to practice a task as well as providing them with feedback. In our example, you could let students try sending you a message on their own computers and then tell them what they did right or where <abbr title="se sont trompés,ont fait un faux pas">they tripped up</abbr>.
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>d. Assessment</li></h6>
<BR>You will then want to plan for assessment in your instructional strategy. In addition to the final assessment we talked about earlier, you may want to include practice assessments, as well as a final attitude assessment, which asks your learners how they felt about the course. 
<BR>
<BR><h6><li>e. follow through activities</li></h6>
<BR>The final thing you want to include in your instructional strategy is a set of follow-through activities.This is a review of the entire course strategy with an eye <abbr title="vers, envers">toward</abbr> helping students internalize and apply the instruction after the class is over.
<BR>
<BR><h4>conclusion</h4>
<BR>So that's the basic overview of the design phase of the Addie model. Designing assessments, choosing the right course format and carefully putting together an instructional strategy will make developing your course content a lot more easy and effective. In our next video, we'll discuss the second D and the Addie process: the development phase. We'll see you then.

            This phase is meant to set the learning guidelines: stages, tools, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning and media selection.

            It is the step when instructional designers and developers create and assemble the content assets that were blueprinted in the design phase.

            During the implementation phase, a procedure for trainers and learners is developed: it includes a review of the course curriculum as well as the teacinh methods.

          <p>
            This last phase is used to review the training, get feedback, and make adjustments if necessary. The ADDIE Model is a continuous circle with overlapping boundaries.
