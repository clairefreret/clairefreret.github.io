<BR><h4>Introduction</h4>

<BR>The ADDIE is an instructional design model that helps instructors, instructional designers and training specialists plan and create instruction. The ADDIE model is used to create all kinds of instruction. From teaching potential stockbrokers about mutual funds to training helicopter pilots on emergency landing techniques. In this presentation,however, we will use simpler examples to illustrate the ADDIE principles. 
<BR>The Addie model includes 5 phases : <BR> 
<BR>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>nalysis</li>
<li><b>D</b>esign</li>
<li><b>D</b>evelopment</li>
<li><b>I</b>mplementation</li>
<li><b>E</b>valuation</li>
</ul>
<BR>Let's take a closer look at the fourth phase, the implementation phase. 
<BR>
<BR><h4>implementation</h4>
<BR>
<BR>There are three parts to the implementation phase:
<BR>1. Training the instructor
<BR>2. Preparing the learners 
<BR>3. Arranging the learning space
<BR>
<BR><h5>1. Train the instructor</h5>
<BR>
<BR>In a lot of cases, the person that developed a course or training is also the one that teaches it. But there are also plenty of situations where the developer turns the course over to a different trainer instructor. 

Let's say a friend <abbr title="embauché/employé">hired</abbr> you to develop the material for his beginning guitar class. After you have gone through the analysis design and development phases, you'll want to train your friend on the instructional material you've developed.  He'll need to know the course objectives and activities you plan and be familiar with all of the media and assessments he is going to use. This means you'll have to have all the materials ready well before the first class session. So your friend has time 

<abbr title="se familiariser">to get acquainted</abbr> with the material and be comfortable with it. In professional settings, developers sometimes have to train dozens of instructors on a particular course or learning module in many different areas. 
<BR>
<BR><h5>2. Prepare the learners</h5>
<BR>

The next part of the implementation phase is preparing the learners for instruction this means making sure they have the <abbr title="outils">tools</abbr> and <abbr title="connaissances">knowledge</abbr> necessary to participate in the class. In higher education settings this means verifying they have taken the proper prerequisites gone through any necessary orientation and are trained on any learning management software that would be utilized in the class. In our example, your friend would have to make sure each student knew when and where the guitar class was taking place, as well as what materials they would have to provide for themselves, like a guitar tuner and pick.
<BR>
<BR><h5>3. Arrange the learning space</h5>
<BR> 

Once the instructor and learners are prepared, it is necessary to make sure that the learning space is arranged. This means more than just making sure there are enough chairs and desks for everyone. Let's say that and our example: Your instructor is going to show your students a video about how to tune guitars. He'll want to make sure that he has the technology available to do this. It is also a good idea to test any multimedia equipment <abbr title="à l'avance/au préalable">beforehand</abbr> in the actual learning space. This will help ensure that the instruction will go <abbr title="en douceur/sans problème">smoothly</abbr> without any technical difficulties. 

Instructors should also do things like print out all the <abbr title="polycopiés">handouts</abbr> they will use during the instruction and make sure they have a whiteboard and markers ready if they are planning on using them. Getting these types of details, squared away beforehand, allows instructors to put their full attention to delivering the course and focusing on the learners experience.

<BR>
<BR><h4>conclusion</h4>
<BR>
So that is it for our basic overview of the implementation phase of the ADDIE model. Properly, training the instructor, preparing the learners and arranging the learning space will make the course delivery much more effective and efficient. 

We will discuss the final phase in the ADDIE process, the evaluation phase. We'll see you then.  </p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            This is the first step of the ADDIE model and relates to the analysis of the learners' needs and the goals to be reached.

          <p>
            This phase is meant to set the learning guidelines: stages, tools, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning and media selection.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            It is the step when instructional designers and developers create and assemble the content assets that were blueprinted in the design phase.

            During the implementation phase, a procedure for trainers and learners is developed: it includes a review of the course curriculum as well as the teacinh methods.

          <p>
            This last phase is used to review the training, get feedback, and make adjustments if necessary. The ADDIE Model is a continuous circle with overlapping boundaries.
